# Dropbox Assessment

This repository contains my submission for the Dropbox Data/Analytics assessment. The goal of this project was to analyze a provided dataset, clean and prepare the data, generate insights, and present findings through a dashboard and executive summary slide.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard

The interactive dashboard provides a visual summary of the cleaned dataset, highlighting trends, outliers, and actionable insights. It includes:

* Key performance indicators
* Filterable charts and tables
* User-friendly layout for stakeholders

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning (Python)

The `data_cleaning.ipynb` notebook walks through the process of:

* Importing and exploring the dataset
* Handling missing or inconsistent data
* Creating calculated columns and aggregations
* Exporting the cleaned dataset for use in the dashboard

## ðŸ–¼ Executive Slide

The `presentation_slide.pptx` file summarizes the most important findings from the analysis. It includes:

* A high-level insight or recommendation
* Visuals or KPIs from the dashboard
* Context for decision-makers
